USA PHP Framework

===================================


USA PHP Framework is an minimalistic IDE-Centric MVC framework(PHP 5.2+, recommend 5.3 or above). Its core part is only a few hundred line, so you can read, debug, modify framework by yourself immediately.


This framework supports all kind of modern web features like  MVC, ORM, REST API, CoC, Input Validation, Remote and local Debug and many more.


This framework will help you to focus on good web application, not framework itself.
